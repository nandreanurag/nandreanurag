## üõ†Ô∏è Key Projects
### **K8s-VulnSage**  **[Link](https://github.com/csye7125-su24-team14/architecture)**
A **RAG-based AI-powered CVE Processing System** leveraging modern cloud-native technologies:  
- Designed and deployed a **distributed RAG model** using **LLama3**, integrated with **Kafka streams** and **Pinecone Vector DB**, improving data insights accessibility by **70%** and decision-making speed by **50%** via a **Streamlit-based GPT interface**.  
- Architected a **scalable, multi-cloud microservices ecosystem** using **Go, Python, and Kafka** for real-time CVE processing, integrated with **PostgreSQL** and orchestrated via **AWS EKS** with **multi-AZ deployment**, achieving **99.9% uptime** and 40% improved reliability.  
- Enhanced security with **Google OAuth** for user authentication and an **AWS Lambda-driven email service** for user verification.  
- Implemented observability by integrating **Fluent Bit** for log aggregation, **OpenTelemetry** for traces, and **Grafana** for visualization, reducing **MTTR** by 50%.  
- Deployed **Istio service mesh** with **Envoy sidecars** and integrated **Kiali dashboard** for traffic management, secure service-to-service communication, and monitoring. Achieved hitless upgrades, reduced system latency by **30%**, and ensured high reliability.  
- Developed a **custom Kubernetes operator** using Kubebuilder to automate GitHub release tracking, leveraging **CRDs**, **RBAC**, and resource limits for a **25% faster release cycle**.  
- Automated infrastructure provisioning and deployment using **Terraform**, **Packer**, and **Helm**, achieving **60% faster deployments**.  
- Built **CI/CD pipelines** using **Jenkins** and **ArgoCD**, reducing deployment times by **50%** and improving consistency by **30%**.  
- Automated **SSL/TLS certificate management** using **cert-manager** and implemented **secret management** with SOPS, achieving **zero downtime** in rotations and a **35% improvement in security posture**.
